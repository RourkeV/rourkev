  <summary>More about me</summary>
  <blockquote>
    Sociable, solutions-oriented, and driven Software Engineering student currently in my third year at Belgium Campus ITversity, with a keen interest for problem-solving, innovation, and teamwork. I offer a unique mix of technical proficiency, business initiative, and leadership skills to the table. I excel in collaborative environments and take initiative when new opportunities arise. I bring not just a strong academic foundation in software engineering but also real-world entrepreneurial experience, having successfully established and operated a caf√© on campus.

    I actively apply my learning to real-world situations. I am now seeking a dynamic and challenging internship for my 4th-year industry placement, where I can learn from industry professionals and contribute meaningfully to their business while growing as a developer.
